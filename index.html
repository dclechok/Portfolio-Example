				<h3>·About Me·</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>I've been passionate about web development since a young kid growing up in the 90's.  After tinkering around in the early years of HTML, on various free web hosting services, I decided that I wanted to invest in my very own domain name.  My parents weren't "believers" in the internet, so I had a better chance of them giving me their paychecks than actually paying for one...</p>
				<p>The only option was to set out on my own...  I found work for someone who was a domain name trader, and she offered to give me a free domain name if I somehow pushed traffic to a website of hers.  Somehow, I figured out just how to do that, and I finally received my first domain name.</p>
				<p>That was many years ago.  After some college, workshops, and countless hours tinkering around in different programming languages, as a hobbyist, I'm finally back to my roots, and where it all started -- <strong>Web Development</strong>.
				<p>Outside of coding and design I like to: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>write and record music</li>
					<li>cook</li>
					<li>live an active lifestyle</li>
					<li>spend time with my wife Nikki, step-son Dylan, and our dog Mirko</li>
				</ul>
